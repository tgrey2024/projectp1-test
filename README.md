## Introduction
Sereniteen is the first HTML/CSS/Bootstrap website that I built as part of my first individual project on the AI-Augmented Full-Stack Bootcamp course at the Code Institute. Its aim is to help site users to understand what anxiety is, how it may affect teenagers, and provide basic guidance and links to resources and professional help.

### Project Brief
The site user's goal is to find "accessible, beginner-friendly information" on a mental health issue. The scope of mental health is very broad, so I have chosen to focus on anxiety in teenagers. The aim is to present information on common symptoms and how to manage stress using a "supportive and organised layout".

### Users
The key users of the site are:
- teenagers - they may be worried about themselves or their friends having anxiety
- parents of teens who may be concerned about their children.
